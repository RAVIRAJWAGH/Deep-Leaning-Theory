Flow of CNN Architecture

Input Layer:

    Receives the input data, often in the form of images (e.g., 2D arrays of pixel values).
    Convolutional Layer:
    
    Applies filters (kernels) that slide over the input to detect features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
    Produces feature maps that highlight the presence of specific features in the input data.
    Followed by an activation function (e.g., ReLU) to introduce non-linearity.
    Activation Function (e.g., ReLU):
    
    Applies a non-linear function to the feature maps to allow the network to learn complex patterns.

Pooling Layer:

    Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps through operations like Max Pooling or Average Pooling.
    Helps to retain the most significant features and reduces computational load.
    

Additional Convolutional and Pooling Layers (Optional):
    
    Multiple convolutional and pooling layers can be stacked to learn more abstract and complex features.
    Each successive layer learns higher-level features, building upon those learned in previous layers.
    

Flattening Layer:
    
    Flattens the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, preparing the data for the fully connected layers.
    

Fully Connected Layer (Dense Layer):
    
    Connects every neuron from the previous layer to every neuron in the current layer.
    Combines the extracted features to make decisions and perform classification or regression.


Output Layer:

    Produces the final predictions.
    For classification tasks, typically uses an activation function like Softmax (for multi-class) or Sigmoid (for binary classification).
    Loss Function and Optimization:
    
    Computes the loss based on the difference between predicted and actual values.
    The optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam) updates the weights of the network to minimize the loss during training.
   

Backpropagation:
    
    Adjusts weights and biases through gradient descent to minimize the loss, optimizing the network's performance.

Key Points:
        Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction.
        Pooling Layers: Dimensionality reduction.
        Fully Connected Layers: Decision making.
        Output Layer: Final predictions.
